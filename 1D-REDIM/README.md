Here the codes about the sensitivity of the 1D REDIM with respect to the gradient estimate are provided.

The program can be run with starting "main_sensivitiy_1D.m".

Several inputs for system are needed:
* enter the diffusion coefficient
* enter the rate coefficient for k_{12}
* enter the rate coefficient for k_{23}
* enter the rate coefficient for k_{34}.

One input for the numerical calculation is needed:
* Enter the number of grid point

One input for the gradient estimate for \psi_1 is needed:
* Enter the gradient estimate
