Here the codes about the sensitivity of the 1D REDIM with respect to the gradient estimate are provided.

The program can be run with starting "main_sensivitiy_1D.m".

Several inputs for system are needed:
* enter the diffusion coefficient
* enter the rate coefficient for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k_1">
* enter the rate coefficient for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k_2">
* enter the rate coefficient for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k_3">

One input for the numerical calculation is needed:
* Enter the number of grid point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n_g">

One input for the gradient estimate for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi_1"> is needed:
* Enter the gradient estimate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi(\psi_1)">

After all these inputs are given, the 1D REDIM will be generated. And the sensivitiy values are also determined.
